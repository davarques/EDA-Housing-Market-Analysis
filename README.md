## Project Overview üìã

In this project, we'll conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Melbourne's housing market dataset from 2016 to 2018 to practice our Python skills. We'll provide the dataset and its information, along with some randomly interesting findings discovered during exploration. For more detailed insights, we recommend reviewing the script attached in teh project, which contains additional details.

Region's grouped in `Price_category` (ranges) visualization with **heatmap**:

* We can see how `Southern Metropolitan` has the highest housing prices.

Analysing the the **frequenecy of property types** (houses, units or townhouse)

* The major porperty type sold in Melbour are `houses`

**Box plot** between `Price` and `Time`:

* We can see a high number of `outliers`

**Scatter Plot:** We can see low negative correlation betwee `Distance` to the city center and `Price`.

Skewness and Kurtosis results:

* Skewness of 2.59 suggests a right-skewed distribution, indicating fewer extreme high values.
* Kurtosis of 13.10 indicates heavy-tailedness, implying more extreme values than a normal distribution. These findings highlight the presence of outliers in the dataset, which could impact analysis and modeling.
