**Scatter Plot:** We can see low negative correlation betwee `Distance` to the city center and `Price`.

* Skewness of 2.59 suggests a right-skewed distribution, indicating fewer extreme high values.
* Kurtosis of 13.10 indicates heavy-tailedness, implying more extreme values than a normal distribution. These findings highlight the presence of outliers in the dataset, which could impact analysis and modeling.
